# GPA
### A tiny GPA calculator in Java

*GPA* is a simple GPA *(Grade Point Average)* calculator in Java, aimed toward students who are interested in calculating their GPA prior to the official release of their GPA.

To use GPA, you must have Java accessible through the command line. If you can run `java` and `javac`, you're good. Simply `cd src/`, `javac *.java`, and then `java GPA` to get up and running with *GPA*.
